Initiating a new run for the pipeline: train_pipeline.
The BaseParameters class to define step parameters is deprecated. Check out our docs https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/advanced-guide/pipelining-features/configure-steps-pipelines for information on how to parameterize your steps. As a quick fix to get rid of this warning, make sure your parameter class inherits from pydantic.BaseModel instead of the BaseParameters class.
Reusing registered pipeline version: (version: 23).

Integer columns in Python cannot represent missing values. If your input data contains missing values at inference time, it will be encoded as floats and will cause a schema enforcement error. The best way to avoid this problem is to infer the model schema based on a realistic data sample (training dataset) that includes missing values. Alternatively, you can declare integer columns as doubles (float64) whenever these columns may have missing values.
